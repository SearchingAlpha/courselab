# Course Creator Platform Requirements

## Project Overview

This document outlines the requirements for developing an automated course creation platform that leverages AI agents to generate structured educational content. The platform enables users to create comprehensive 120-hour courses with minimal input, following a structured workflow defined by specific triggers.

## Tech Stack Requirements

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Supabase
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **AI Integration**: LLM API integration (Claude/GPT)
- **Code Standards**: Functional programming patterns, React Server Components where possible

## Core System Requirements

### 1. User Authentication & Management

- User registration and login via email/password and OAuth providers
- User profiles with course creation history
- Role-based access control (basic users, educators, admins)
- Account settings and preferences management

### 2. Course Creation Workflow

The system must implement a structured workflow with specific keyword triggers:

#### 2.1 Course Definition (`define-course`)
- Form to collect course topic, end goal, knowledge level, focus preference (math/code/balanced), and theory/practice preference
- Storage of course metadata for subsequent steps
- Generation of course outline based on user inputs

#### 2.2 Syllabus Generation (`generate-syllabus`) 
- Creation of a complete structured syllabus for a 120-hour course
- Division into chapters/modules with estimated time allocation
- Progressive concept building toward a final project
- University-level course structure formatting

#### 2.3 Textbook Generation (`generate-textbook`)
- Chapter-by-chapter creation of detailed theoretical guides
- In-depth concept explanations with real-life examples
- Visual aid inclusion (equations, diagrams, charts)
- Chapter length limitation (max 10 pages per chapter)
- Support for `next-chapter` command to proceed sequentially

#### 2.4 Exercise Generation (`generate-exercises`)
- Creation of Jupyter notebook-style exercises for each chapter
- Implementation of guided exercises with step-by-step solutions
- Independent exercise problems for user practice
- Real-world scenario integration
- Python-based implementations with visualization outputs

#### 2.5 Project Generation (`generate-project`)
- Design of a capstone project that builds across all chapters
- Mini-project components for each chapter
- Convergence into a comprehensive final project
- Jupyter notebook delivery format
- Focus on applied knowledge and creativity

### 3. AI Agent System

- Modular agent architecture with specialized agents for each workflow step
- Orchestration layer to manage inter-agent communication
- Prompt engineering system with templating
- Response processing and formatting
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- API integration with LLM providers (rate limiting, error handling, etc.)

### 4. Content Management

- Storage of all generated content (syllabi, textbooks, exercises, projects)
- Content versioning and revision history
- Export functionality (PDF, Jupyter notebooks)
- Content organization by course, chapter, and type
- Search and filtering capabilities

### 5. User Interface Requirements

- Clean, intuitive, mobile-responsive interface
- Workflow progress indication
- Real-time content generation feedback
- Content preview and navigation
- Accessible design (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Dark/light mode support

## Performance Requirements

- Server-side rendering for initial page loads
- Minimal client-side JavaScript
- Optimized Web Vitals (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, FID < 100ms)
- Efficient handling of long-running LLM operations with streaming responses
- Caching of common responses to reduce API costs
- Pagination for large content sections

## Security Requirements

- Input sanitization for all user inputs
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Secure storage of API keys and credentials
- Content moderation to prevent misuse

## Development Standards

### Naming Conventions
- Directories: kebab-case
- Variables and functions: camelCase
- Components: PascalCase
- Component files: PascalCase
- Other files: kebab-case
- Component prefixing by type (e.g., ButtonSubmit, CardChapter)

### Code Organization
- Functional programming patterns (avoid classes)
- Exported component first, followed by subcomponents, helpers, and static content
- Server Components by default, Client Components only when necessary
- Minimal use of useState and useEffect
